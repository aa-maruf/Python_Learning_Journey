N:B : YOU MUST USE THE NAME OF THE FUNCTION WRITTEN IN EACH QUESTION

1. Create a string out of some words given in a list -

l = ["This", "is", "very", "fantastic"]


Expected Output:
"This is very fantastic"

Write a function named create_string() and write your code inside this function.

2. Use web search to find some API to get weather data. Use that to get your region’s weather data every 30 minute.

Write a function named weather_data() and write your code inside this function.

3. Go to this repo: https://pypi.org/project/pyjokes/ and try to make a chat bot to tell you joke using pyjokes.
Write a function named tell_some_jokes() and write your code inside this function.

4. Fix this code, get help from google. Copy the error message and search on web.
def print_hi():
    print("hi")

print(print_hi()) # you can't change this lin



5. You have given a dictionary ‘d’, convert it into a list. The first value will be the key of the dict, and value will come next. 

Example
x = { 'a' : 1, 'b' :  2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
output:  [ 'a', 1, 'b',  2, 'c', 3, 'd', 4]


Now do the same for -
d = {'!': 1, '@' : 2, '#': 3, '$' : 4, '%' : 5, '^' : 6}


Write a function named create_list() and write your code inside this function.

6. Complete the following code
def clean_string(text):
    ....
    ....
    print(output)
    
s = "P::::::,,,,,h;;;;i,,,t--r;,:o..N"

output = clean_string(s)
print(output)


If you face any errors, fix them. Get help from google. Do not ask others.


7. Complete the following code (without using the replace function)-

def replace_comma_with_space(text):
    …
    …

s = "I,have,been,practising,python,since,the,course,started"

output = replace_comma_with_space(s)
print(output)



8. Suppose you have a program that converts a string into Upper, Capitalized and Lower style using three different functions. Now create a test script for testing the three functionality of that program. Run using PyTest.

Write a function make_upper() to make the string in uppercase
Write a function make_capital() to make the string capitalized
Write a function make_lower() to make the string lowercase

Write a function named test_script() and write your code inside this function.


9. You need to make a positive story into a negative by changing some of its words automatically. Someone gave you a list `replace with’ and asked to find the words that are in that list in string ‘s’ and replace them with the next word of that list.

replace_with = ["chief", "thief", "superintendent", "sweeper", "married", "left", "tried", "died"]

s = "I am the chief of Baghdad. Before that I used to be a superintendent of Bank Asia. Things have changed a lot since Jorina married me. A lot of girls tried to marry me."


Output example (one done for you): 
"I am the thief of Baghdad..........."


Write a function named replace_word() and write your code inside this function.

10. Given a string ‘s’ you need to find the words that are in list ‘a’ and use the next words on string ‘s’ to create a new string. Save it inside a file called ‘out.txt’. Remember to close the file after writing.

Write a function named create_new_string() and write your code inside this function.

a = ['oh', 'Emelia', 'to']

s = "Oh, I got two tickets for Dhaka. I and Emelia love to visit different places very much. This time we are going to Bangladesh."

output = "I love Bangladesh" (inside a file)
